const express = require('express') // this import method is used in backend
import express from "express"
// but if you want to import anything from frontend, syntax changes
module.exports = App; // backend
export default App; // frontend
Our React app consists of a Main Parent component, called App.js. 
Component is basically a function which returns html.
Components are always imported with capital letter

Make a react app, which contains 5 components,
1=> Navbar
2=> Center component
3=> List component which shows list of 5 fruites
4=> A form component which takes 3 inputs, name,email,password
5=> footer component
Ps: You can use bootstrap
The component where other child components are called is called Parent Component for those components.
Component is basically a function which returns html.
Component is basically a function which returns jsx.
jsx stands for javascript xml.
JSX = 99% html + 1% variation
Migrating from HTML to jsx requires following variations-
1. class is changed with className ( To differentiate between oops class and css class)
2. JSX always returns a single element (Single element means enclosed with a single tag i.e. start and end with same tag)
To deal with this we always return compoents with a single tag i.e. <> and </>
3. Single tags needs a self enclosing tag 
i.e. <img> changes to <img/>
    <a> changes to <a/>
    <br> changes to <br/>
    <input> changes to <input />
4.html attributes are the additional information written in starting tags of html elements
e.g className,id,name,src,href,alt etc
In react, we need to make this sure that jsx attributes  always be written
in camelcase method.
(camelcase means every new word should starts with capital letter (except first, which is always written in small))
html attribute e.g. onclick,onmousehover ,onmouseover are converted into jsx attribute in camelcase
jsx attribute e.g. onClick,onMouseHover,onMouseOver
In react, CSS is used in same way as in normal html
All the properties of css are exactly same.
css can be used in two ways...
1. by making a separate file and writing usual css code with classname and stuufs
2. In-line css.  Here, we write the css code on the tag itself as an attribute
 In line css is done using "style" attribute
 In line css is done inside style attribute by putting double curly brackets. {{}}

 Parent-Child architecture of compoents
 Component return JSX(Modified html)
 JSX rules
 Use of bootstrap and practicing jsx components.
 Use of CSS (Both Inline css, and External css)
 Use of Javascript in html (jsx) (important)
1. Use of Javascript in two ways
a> Javascript code is written above return statement
b> Inline javascript => Javascript is always written inside html, with a curly bracket
onClick attribute is used when we want to do some action (function)
on click of that button/tag

Whenever we want our same component to show different information, according to different
case, then this is acheived by javascript (called dynamic rendering)
case, then this is acheived by javascript (called dynamic rendering)


DOM defines the logical structure of documents 
and the way a document is accessed and manipulated with the help of javascript.
Dom is of Two types i.e.

1. Real DOM
Real DOM updates slow, because it updates the overall document and
and reloading takes place

2. Virtual DOM
Virtual DOM updates faster because it only updates that particular component which is changed
not the whole document.


USESTATE
Whenever we update value of a variable in a component using normal updation,
then that component is not updated and reflects the previous value only.

This can be solved by refreshing our component, everytime when any value is changed,
This can be acheived using useState.
Usestates updates the component whenever state changes

variable ===> state
updating variable ===> setstate
